# Custom Scarface Character Pack
Due to licensing issues, Overkill has removed the Scarface Charaacter Pack from the Steam store, leaving the Kingpin perk deck, Little Friend 7.62 Assault Rifle, Lumber Lite L2 melee weapon, Scarface & Scarface Begins masks, as well as the Scarface character unavailable.

This mod restores the weapons and masks, while not giving the user a cheater tag. The weapons and items are duplicated as a custom weapon and are tweaked to appear as a different weapon:

| Item | Appears as |
|---|---|
| Scarface (mask) | Dallas (mask) |
| Scarface Begins | Dallas begins |
| Little Friend 7.62 Assault Rifle | AMCAR Assault Rifle |
| Lumber Lite L2 | Ice Pick |

The Little Friend 7.62 Assault Rifle also includes 3 skins:
| Skin | Rarity | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chupacabra | Common | [Steam Community Market (Mint Condition)](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/218620/LITTLE%20FRIEND%207.62%20ASSAULT%20RIFLE%20%7C%20Chupacabra%2C%20Mint-Condition) |
| Battle Zone | Common | [Steam Community Market (Mint Condition)](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/218620/LITTLE%20FRIEND%207.62%20ASSAULT%20RIFLE%20%7C%20Battle%20Zone%2C%20Mint-Condition) |
| Mansion Mauler | Legendary | [Steam Community Market (Mint Condition)](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/218620/LITTLE%20FRIEND%207.62%20ASSAULT%20RIFLE%20%7C%20Mansion%20Mauler%20%2C%20Mint-Condition) |

The Kingpin perk deck has not been implemented, but may be acquired from other mods. The character, Scarface, may be implemented in the future.

## Known Issues
- When quitting the game, if the current loadout has its melee as the custom Lumber Lite L2, it will not save and revert to weapon butt when re-opening the game.
	- This can be fixed by switching to another loadout before quitting the game.
